 INSTALL PROCESS
=================

==== Prepare the files 

- Create a netdb user on your system

adduser netdb

- Untar the netdb.tar.gz file to /opt

tar zxvf netdb.tar.gz -C /opt/

- Create netdb directories and set permissions. I usually add the netdb user to
  the adm group to get logging working

mkdir /var/log/netdb
chown -R netdb /opt/netdb/
chgrp -R netdb /opt/netdb/
chown netdb /var/log/netdb/
chgrp apache /var/log/netdb/

usermod -a -G adm netdb

- Create local/bin symlinks for netdb scripts:

ln -s /opt/netdb/netdb.pl /usr/local/bin/netdb
ln -s /opt/netdb/netdbctl.pl /usr/local/bin/netdbctl

- Install netdb-logrotate in /etc/logrotate.d/

cp /opt/netdb/extra/netdb-logrotate /etc/logrotate.d/


==== Create the database in mysql on the local server

- Check your linux MySQL install for these credentials, if you connect as root
  on Debian it shouldn't require a password or -p unless someone has set one

mysql -u root -p

create database netdb;
use netdb;
source /opt/netdb/createnetdb.sql

- If you are using the local MySQL database and not hosting this on an external
  MySQL server, create a read-only user and an admin user

- Change the password after "IDENTIFIED BY" from the default values, make sure
  to update the /etc/netdb.conf with these new passwords

CREATE USER 'netdbuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'netdb3742';
GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'netdbuser'@'localhost';

CREATE USER 'netdbadmin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'netdbadmin3742';
GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,LOCK TABLES,SHOW VIEW,DELETE ON *.* TO 'netdbadmin'@'localhost';


- Exit MySQL

exit

Note: Most will be fine with the default config, but if you have a very large
network, you may want to look at the my.cnf file which increases memory
allocated to MySQL and has several performance increases.


==== MySQL User Setup Details for external database servers

- If you pasted in the CREATE USER commands above and are hosting the MySQL
  database on the local server, ignore this section

- Give the netdbadmin user INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE and DELETE privileges

- Give the netdbuser user SELECT only privileges (Can use the same user as
  above, mainly for CGI use)

- Update the config file with your username and passwords in the MySQL Database
  Details section (instructions below)


===== Install Perl Modules

- Add NetDB Perl modules NetDBHelper.pm and NetDB.pm to your perl library path
  (you may need to check your system or use /usr/local/lib/)

mkdir /usr/lib/perl5/Net/
ln -s /opt/netdb/NetDBHelper.pm /usr/lib/perl5/NetDBHelper.pm
ln -s /opt/netdb/NetDB.pm /usr/lib/perl5/NetDB.pm


===== Debian Lenny/Ubuntu Instructions (generalized instructions below):

== Option #1 for Perl Modules Install on Debian and Ubuntu

Debian Linux - lenny - Setup for NetDB
Denny Fox - 1/19/2010

These were necessary on a minimal fresh install of lenny to provide the packages to support NetDB and CPAN.

NetDB Perl module         req  lenny package
---------------------	  ----------------------
List::MoreUtils		  liblist-moreutils-perl
DBI                       libdbi-perl
Net::DNS                  libnet-dns-perl
DateTime		  libdatetime-perl
DateTime::Format::MySQL	  libdatetime-format-mysql-perl
Time::HiRes		  (should already be installed, included in package perl)
		          - no man page but module is there
Data::UUID		  libossp-uuid-perl
Digest::HMAC		  libdigest-hmac-perl
Digest::SHA1		  libdigest-sha1-perl
Net::MAC::Vendor 	  install dependency libwww-perl then install via CPAN
Net::SSH::Expect	  install dependency libexpect-perl then install via CPAN
Net::Telnet::Cisco  	  libnet-telnet-cisco-perl
Net::IP                   libnet-ip-perl
AppConfig		  libappconfig-perl  
Proc::Queue		  install via CPAN (Test::More dependency is part of perl-modules in the base install)
Proc::ProcessTable        libproc-processtable-perl
File::Flock		  libio-lockedfile-perl - no man page but module is there
NetAddr::IP		  libnetaddr-ip-perl
IO::Socket::INET	  (should already be installed, included in package perl-base)
			   - no man page but module is there


apt-get install liblist-moreutils-perl libdbi-perl libnet-dns-perl libdatetime-perl \
libdatetime-format-mysql-perl libossp-uuid-perl libdigest-hmac-perl libdigest-sha1-perl libwww-perl \
libexpect-perl libnet-telnet-cisco-perl libappconfig-perl libio-lockedfile-perl libnetaddr-ip-perl \
libnet-ip-perl libio-socket-inet6-perl libfile-flock-perl libproc-processtable-perl

apt-get will automatically take care of sub-dependencies on these 14 packages. On my system this
resulted in 42 packages being installed.

CPAN dependencies:

apt-get install libyaml-perl unzip make bzip2 curl lynx ncftp ftp patch makepatch

CPAN will work without some of these, but these packages will satisfy all the questions that a
manual 'o conf init' will ask. Installing these will allow you to take the 'yes' option and let CPAN
configure itself automatically.


- CPAN Setup (do not do manual configure, instead choose auto):

perl -MCPAN -e 'shell'

Would you like me to configure as much as possible automatically? [yes]

... CPAN configures itself ...
cpan[1]> q

- edit Config.pm to use the main ftp site as suggested:

vi /etc/perl/CPAN/Config.pm (or /root/.cpan/CPAN/MyConfig.pm)
Change
  'urllist' => [],
To
  'urllist' => [q[ftp://ftp.perl.org/pub/CPAN/]],

- Install remaining perl packages:

perl -MCPAN -e 'shell'

install Net::MAC::Vendor
install Net::SSH::Expect
install Proc::Queue

quit


===== Generalized Perl Modules Install (Non-Debian/Ubuntu)

== Option #2 for Perl Modules Install

- Install Required CPAN Modules:

perl -MCPAN -e 'shell'
o conf init

Note: I usually use ftp://ftp.perl.org/pub/CPAN/ as my mirror, since so many mirrors have issues

Modules to install on CentOS:
install List::MoreUtils
install DBI
install Net::DNS
install Math::Round
install Module::Implementation
install Attribute::Handlers
install Params::Validate
install DateTime::Locale
install DateTime::TimeZone
install DateTime
install DateTime::Format::MySQL
install Time::HiRes
install Data::UUID
install Digest::HMAC
install Digest::SHA1
install Net::MAC::Vendor 
install Net::SSH::Expect
install Net::Telnet::Cisco  ## Only install if Telnet is required
install Net::IP
install AppConfig
install Proc::Queue
install Proc::ProcessTable
install File::Flock
install NetAddr::IP
install IO::Socket::INET
install IO::Socket::INET6
install ExtUtils::Constant
install ExtUtils::CBuilder
install Socket


===== Configuration File

-  Copy netdb.conf to /etc/ and edit the options for your environment 

- Set the devuser, devpass, devuser2, and devpass2 variables.  Leave the
  enablepasswd commented out and the script will not try to enable the session.

- NetDB only needs level 5 priviledges to run and does not need enable level
  access.  ASA support requires enable support to grab the ARP table, so it's
  best to setup a privileged netdb user or change the ARP command's privilege
  level to not require enable privileges on the ASA.

- If you plan to enable vlan changes from the web interface, the netdb user will
  need rights to do this.

- Configure the use_telnet and use_ssh variables in the scraper section.
  Enabling both will prefer ssh and fallback to telnet.  If you use forcessh or
  forcetelnet in the devicelist file, these variables are ignored.  

- Optionally tweak the mac_format, scraper_count and proc_delay settings.

- If you are running vmware servers on trunk ports, see the use_trunks and max_macs section

- Configure your Database Settings, if you don't want a read only user, use the same username and password

- Optional: create a list of static IPs from your DHCP server and put them each on
  a line in a file.  Then set the statics_file variable to this file location and
  run netdbctl -s from cron (see below)

  Bluecat DHCP users: There is a getstatics.sh script in the extra/ directory
  to pull all static and DHCP reserved addresses from Bluecat to import in to
  netdb.

===== Create a /opt/netdb/data/devicelist.csv file

This file contains all of your switches and routers, and scraper options on
each device.  It is in csv format, so you can easily build your own parser from
another list of devices you already have.  We use big brother here and store all
the netdb options in that file, which is parsed in to this file.  

Important Note: Ideally all devices in the devicelist.csv file should be
hostnames that resolve in DNS.  If your devices are not registered in DNS, the
second best option is to build a /etc/hosts file for your devices so the names
resolve to IP addresses.  The final option is to use IP addresses in the
devicelist.csv file and enable the gethost option in the /etc/netdb.conf file.
This is the least preferred option because it impacts performance to a large
degree, but is an option if you can not use a hosts file or register your
devices in DNS.

Hostnames are also used for prompt matching for SSH.  If the local hostname on
your device does not match the hostname from DNS (not including the domain),
scraper performance will be affected.

Device file format (each device on a line):
hostname[,arp,vrf-VRFNAME,nomac,forcessh,ipv6]

Note: 
 - SSH is enabled and telnet is disabled by default in the netdb.conf config
   file.  You can override those settings on a per device basis with forcetelnet
   and forcessh.
 - By default, NetDB will try to pull the mac table from all devices in the file
 - If ,arp is appended, then NetDB will pull the arp table on a router
 - If ,vrf-VRFNAME is appended with arp, NetDB will pull the arp table
   from the vrf named VRFNAME
 - If ipv6 is appended, NetDB will pull the IPv6 Neighbor Table
 - If ,nomac is appended, NetDB will not try to pull the mac or int status
   data from the device (usefule for non-switching routers)
 - If you do not want to use FQDNs here, make sure the domain name for your devices
   is in your DNS search domain or use the local /etc/hosts file.
 - If your device is not a cisco device, you need to append devtype=XXX or change the
   default devtype setting in netdb.conf (see README for more info)

Sample devicelist.csv:
L2switch.yourdomain.com
L3Switch.yourdomain.com,arp,forcessh
L3SwitchWithVrfs.yourdomain.com,arp,vrf-perim,vrf-guest
traditional-router.yourdomain.com,arp,ipv6,nomac,forcetelnet

junosEX4200.yourdomain.com,arp,devtype=junos
ciscowlc1.yourdomain.com,devtype=ciscowlc
aruba1.yourdomain.com,devtype=aruba
asafirewall.domain.com,devtype=asa,nomac
procurve.domain.com,devtype=procurvehp,arp



===== ARP Table Requirements

In order to map mac addresses to IP addresses, you need to set netdbarp on the
devices that hold the ARP tables for your network.  Switches do not know about
IP addresses.  Only devices configured as routers on your network need to be
configured with netdbarp, which is likely not every switch on your network.  If
you are only getting IP addresses for your management network (Vlan1), you need
to make sure your router is included in the devicelist and configured for
netdbarp.

If your router is a non-cisco device on a small network, or you only have one
subnet, you can capture data from the NetDB server's ARP table.  Schedule this
in cron separate from the normal update.  You probably want to ping scan your network
before you run this command:

#!/bin/sh
# Non-cisco router hack to get your local server's ARP table in to the database
nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24
arp -a | perl -nle 'split(/\s+/); $_[1] =~ s/\(|\)//g; print "$_[1],$_[3],0,$_[6]";' > /opt/netdb/data/arptable.txt
netdbctl -a


===== Test out the install:

- There is a troubleshooting section below if any of these steps fail.

- If you run in to any problems, check the control.log and netdb.error log. Try
  running netdbctl with a debug level (netdbctl -debug 3)

- Check the database connection and the install buy running "netdb -i 1.1.1.1"
  (nothing should return, just check for errors) If you have any errors, the
  output should usually give you a good clue as to what to fix.

- Note those using Net::Telnet::Cisco (optional, not required)

 If you get the annoying message "Use of /g modifier is meaningless in split at 
 /usr/local/share/perl/5.10.0/Net/Telnet/Cisco.pm line 756." open the Cisco.pm library
 and change that line from:

       return wantarray ? split /$/mg, $_ : $_; # ORS instead?

       to this:
       return wantarray ? split /$/m, $_ : $_; # ORS instead?

  This is a known bug in the Cisco.pm module and it no longer seems to be maintained.  
  Consider using SSH across the board.

- Try to scrape devices for data for the first time, add a -debug value if there
  are problems
  > netdbctl -ud -v

- Check for any errors, see if the files arptable.txt and mactable.txt look correct
  in /opt/netdb/data directory

- Import data in to database (run this twice the first time)
 > netdbctl -a -m -debug 3

- Optionally import your static addresses
 > netdbctl -s

- Check control.log for any errors

- Check the size of the data in the database
   netdb -st

Example Output:

  NetDB Statistics
 ---------------------------------
   MAC Entries:      55240
   ARP Entries:      169166
   Switch Entries:   47508
   Status Entries:   40403
   DB Transactions:  3901
   Total Rows in DB: 316218

- Run netdb on one of your up addresses to see if it made it in the database
   netdb -i 10.1.1.1

===== Reset the debug level to 0 =====
- Set the debug option in /etc/netdb.conf to 0 (at the end of the file)

===== Setup crontab to automatically update the database

- Append your /etc/crontab with the jobs from extra/crontab.  Reload your cron
  server.

- If you are using SSH, you probably want to uncomment the cronjob to remove the
  known_hosts file for the netdb user.  As devices are replaced or upgraded,
  their ssh keys change, causing login failures (seen in the control logs).

- Monitor your control.log for any errors, you can grep -i error
  /var/log/netdb/control.log

- Any serious errors at the library or database level will be in
  /var/log/netdb.error

===== Database backup =====

- Consider how you will backup the MySQL database.  You can use the netdbctl -bu
  command to perform database backups.  Simply copying the files from the
  /var/mysql/ directories is not enough (for any MySQL database).  Check google
  for MySQL backup best practices.

===== Web Interface Install =====

- Install netdb.cgi.pl for the web interface (highly recommended, see the
  screenshots on sourceforge). The install instructions are at the top of the
  netdb.cgi.pl file in the /opt/netdb/ directory.


===== IPv6 Setup =====

- Append ,ipv6 to any device in the device file you want to capture the neighbor
  table on

- If you have an older install of NetDB, make sure "ipv6_file = ipv6nt.csv" is
  in your netdb.conf file.

- Add the -v6 option to your netdbctl cron job to import the v6 neighbor table


===== MRTG/Cacti Graphs =====
- Check out the extra/mrtg.conf and extra/update-statistics.sh file for ideas for
  generating graphs on your data in the database. You can graph daily number of ARP
  and MAC entries, switchports in use, and network growth over time.

===== Bradford or Generalized NAC Integration ===== 

- There's an option to integrate with Bradford NAC or to import generalized NAC
  registration data in to NetDB.  Bradford integration now relies on the client
  dump file off the NAC server.  You'll need to setup a cronjob to send it over
  to your NetDB server to be imported on a regular basis.  The database method
  proved to be too much trouble and not accurate enough to support.

- See the bradford/bclientdump.pl script and the sample netdb.conf file for options
  configuring this.

- To invoke the script, run netdbctl.pl -un2 to update the nac.csv file from the
  Bradford client dump file, then netdbctl.pl -n to import that data.

- If you are not using Bradford, and have prepared your own nac.csv file, you
  can just do a netdbctl.pl -n to import that data.  See the bclientdump.pl
  script for the file format.

===== Changing VLANs from the Web Interface =====

- If you want to allow users to change vlans from the web interface, first
  install the netdb.cgi.pl CGI script.

- Once installed, uncomment vlan_script in /etc/netdb-cgi.conf and edit the
  vlan_change access level to allow access to specified users, or to allow a
  user access to specific switches.

- Make sure www-data can write to the /var/log/netdb/vlanchange.log file.
  Records are also kept in the NetDB transaction log (netdb -t).

- If you run in to any issues, check your apache error logs for clues.  You can
  also run the vlan_change script from the CLI.

===== Database Maintenance / Deleting Data =====

- Once the number of ARP entries grows to over 1 million rows, wildcard text
  searches for hostnames can start to take more time to execute.  Scale this
  back to improve performance.

- To delete old data, see the delete options in netdbctl

- To backup and restore the database (DO THIS before running these methods), see the netdbctl backup and restore
  methods.

Example Delete Routine:

Backup database to a netdb writable location:
> netdbctl -bu /home/netdb/backup.sql

Get deletion statistics for so many days:
> netdbctl -dt -d 300

  NetDB Delete Statistics over 365 days
 ---------------------------------
   MAC Entries:      29548
   ARP Entries:      236998
   Switch Entries:   40446
   Registrations:    129
   Total Deletable Rows: 306992

 Note: Deleting MAC entries will delete all previously associated ARP, switch and registration
 entries. If you combine these statistics with an SQL IP filter and delete the matched mac entries,
 the related switch and NAC registration data will also be deleted.  The MAC address is the primary
 key for those tables.

Restrict deleted data by IP via SQL query:
> netdbctl -dt -d 300 -ip 10.24.%
  NetDB Delete Statistics over 300 days
 ---------------------------------
   MAC Entries:      46
   ARP Entries:      134

Delete MAC entries and associated ARP, switchport and registration data, 
option -dm cascades due to foreign key contraints unlike -da or -ds:
> netdbctl -dm -d 300 -ip 10.24.%

Are you sure you want to delete these 46 records from the database?  Did you do a backup using netdbctl first?
Confirm Deletion of Data. [yes/no]: yes
Deleting Data from Database...done.

===============
Troubleshooting
===============

- If it's running extremely slow when you do an ARP import in to the database, you likely have a reverse DNS issue on
  your network.  Make sure your DNS servers are properly configured or try a local caching BIND server.  You can also
  disable DNS lookups with disable_DNS, see the netdb.conf file for ideas on how to use this.

- If you are having issues with data showing up in the database, first start by turning debugging on in /etc/netdb.conf
  to level 3

- Check to see if the MAC or ARP data is getting in to the data files arptable.txt and mactable.txt files by grepping
  for some device data in /opt/netdb/data/.

- If you are not getting ARP data, make sure you append the devicelist.csv file entry with: device.domain.com,netdbarp

- If data is not getting populated, you have a scraper problem.  Run netdbctl with the -v or -vv option to debug any 
  scraper issues.

- If the data is in the files, check the database: mysql -u netdb -p -h localhost

use netdb;
select * from switchports;
select * from ipmac; # where ip='1.1.1.1';

show tables;
describe ipmac;
