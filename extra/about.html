  <h3>Network Tracking Database (NetDB)</h3>
  NetDB keeps a history of all network devices and can be used to track any change on the network.  Use it to get the history of a switchport, hostname, MAC address or IP address.  NetDB can also be used to search for NIC vendor codes on campus or to find out if an IP address is registered as static or dynamic.  The database is updated every fifteen minutes.  ARP entries can take one hour to time out, but the switchport timestamps are always accurate to within 15 minutes.

<h3>Search Types</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hostnames: Search for short names (l-01234), FQDNs (l-01234.domain.com) or partial names (ie. xrx)</li>
<li>IP Addresses: Search for an IPv4/IPv6 Address or a "Class C" (10.28.24.)</li>
<li>MAC Addresses: Search for a MAC address in any format, xx:xx for last 4 digits, xx:xx:xx* or *xx:xx:xx.</li>
<li>Static Address: Search for an IP address or hostname to see if address is registered as a static IP</li>
<li>Vendor Codes: Search for a string contained in the vendor code like <a href="/cgi-bin/netdb.pl?address=Apple&vendor=1&days=7">Apple</a> and select "Vendor Search"</li>
<li>VLAN Search: Search for a Vlan (ie. 200) and select "Devices on a VLAN"</li>
<li>Switch Report: Search for a switch name and select "Switch Report", select days in the past</li>
<li>Unused Ports: Search for a switch name or "all" and select "Unused Ports", select days in the past</li>
<li>Switch VLAN Report: Search for a Vlan and select "Switch Ports on a VLAN", then select days in the past</li>
</ul>
  <h3>Usage Tips</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Use wildcards when searching for switches or unused ports to group by *name*</li>
  <li>Remotely wake up computers with Wake On Lan (if configured)</li>
  <li>Click on Excel Report to download your results as a spreadsheet</li>
  <li>You can now sort your results by clicking on the column names</li>
  <li>Search for partial hostnames (l-01234), partial IP addresses (10.28.24.) or a mac address in any format</li>
  <li>Searches are performed over a 7 day period by default, change this with the days option</li>
  <li>ARP Table entries can be up to one hour old, switchport information is more accurate</li>
  </ul>
