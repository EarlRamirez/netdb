#########################
# Authentication Groups #
#########################
# If you have multiple sets of login credentials, you can setup groups of
# usernames, passwords and enable passwords here.  To add a device to a group
# called group1 in the example, specify the device under authgroup or add
# ,authgroup=group1 in your devicelist.csv file.

#authgroup_user group1 = group1username
#authgroup_pass group1 = group1password

# Append ,authgroup=group1 in your devicelist.csv or add the device name here to
# the authgroup

# authgroup group1 = switch1 switch2 switch3

# Update Interval in minutes #
################################################################################
# Set this to be the number of minutes between updates in your crontab (default
# 15minutes) to keep track of how long a device has been on a port.

######################################################################
# Use Fully Qualified Domain Name for switches instead of hostname   #
######################################################################
# Do not change this if you have historical data you want to preserve.
# This will change all of the names of your switches, for example
# switch1.domain.com will be used instead of just switch1
#
# You must also add use_fqdn = 1 to your netdb-cgi.conf file
#
# use_fqdn = 1

############################
# Get hostname from switch #
############################
#
# For best performance, all of your switches should be registered in DNS and you
# should be using those FQDNs in the devicelist.csv file rather than IP
# addresses.  Those hostnames should also match the switch's configured
# hostname.
#
# If you are using IP addresses in your devicelist.csv file instead, you can
# enable this option to grab the hostname from the switch.  This will
# significantly slow down SSH scraping performance.
#
# Supported on ios and nxos devices only
#

###############################################
# Disable Reverse DNS Lookups on ARP Table Data
###############################################
# Note: This is useful for troubleshooting slow import performance. You may also
# use it if your reverse zones are broken and out of your control.
#
# netdbctl -f, which forces hostname updates, does not pay attention to this
# flag.  This may be useful if you want fast ARP updates and only occasional DNS
# lookups once a day for instance.  Control this through cron.

###########################
# Device Scraper Settings #
###########################

# By default, SSH is enabled, telnet is disabled (even if these options are
# commented out).  You can add ,forcetelnet or ,forcessh in your devicelist.csv
# file for specific devices to override these global settings.

# Enable SSH Support
use_ssh    = 1

# Enable Telnet Support (SSH Falls back to telnet if enabled)
use_telnet = 0

# The default device type is ios, but you can change it to the scraper of your
# choice (junos,aruba,ciscowlc,asa,ios):
#
# devtype = ios


# Neighbor Discovery: Gather LLDP/CDP/FDP data if available
#
# Optionally append ,nd to individual devices in the devicelist.csv file
#
use_nd = 1

## Multi-process scraper options, increases load on server but can
## increase performance by launching more sessions in parallel.

# Number of processes to spawn when capturing data from devices
# 100 works well on many machines for faster performance
scraper_count = 20


# Seconds of delay before launching another process (default 0.5s)
# Enable this for more aggressive polling
#proc_delay = 0.2


# SSH Timeout (Default 10sec)
#
# Only adjust this if you are having performance issues or missing data.
#
# ssh_timeout = 10

# Login Timeout for SSH
#
# Logins always take as long as the ssh_timeout, if you want faster logins but
# want to give more time for commands to return for large ARP tables etc, adjust
# this for faster logins.  SSH Commands should look for the hostprompt and
# return as soon as a command finishes, but logins take a set amount of time.
# For faster times with hostprompt matching, set the ssh_timeout as high as it
# needs to be for any command to return given that it will usually return
# faster.  Then set the login_timeout as low as logins take for faster logins.
#
# Note: Can pass individual login_timeouts to device via devicelist.csv
# Add: ,login_time=XX
#
# login_timeout = 12


# SSH Port
#
# Set an alternative SSH Port for all devices
# Alternatively, add ,ssh_port=XX to individual devices via devicelist.csv
#
# ssh_port = 22


# Telnet timeout in seconds (default is 20 seconds)
# If the timeout is too short, commands can timeout on big tables
#
# telnet_timeout = 20


# Maximum macs on a port to accept in to database (start with default)
#
# You can override this value on any individual switch by appending max_macs=XX
# in the devicelist file:
# switchname.domain.com,max_macs=100
#
# If you have a lot of hubs and unmanaged switches on your network, you can
# raise the number of macs to accept on a port before it's considered an uplink
# port and discarded.
#
# Mac address data on trunk ports is discarded by default.  You can choose to
# include data from edge trunk ports below for VMWare servers or other such
# configurations.
#
# If you are using custom data sources for switchport mac data and do not have
# interface status information, this setting will prevent uplink port data from
# being imported.
#
max_macs = 30


# Importing from Edge Trunk Ports
#
# Import mac data from trunk ports in to the database on these switches if they
# don't exceed the max_macs count. Use this for scenarios such as vmware servers
# on trunk ports or non-managed downstream switches.  Make sure that the
# max_macs setting is set below the number of macs on your upstream trunk port
# or you could flood the database with bad data.
#
# A setting of use_trunks = DEFAULT will include trunk data from all switches
#
# You can also add use_trunks to individual switches in the devicelist.csv file
#
# Another option is to select specific ports with use_port below
#
# Do not include the full domain name here, just the hostname (unless use_fqdn
# is set)
#
#use_trunks = switch1
#use_trunks = switch2


# Skip Specific Ports
#
# If you need to exclude a port for any reason from tracking, include the switch
# and ports here.  Alternatively you can put
# switch,skip_port=Gi5/1,skip_port=Gi5/2 in the devicelist.csv file
#
# skip_port switch1 = Gi1/1 Gi2/2 Gi3/3


# Use Specific Ports
#
# If you want to force importing data from certain ports, you can use use_port
# which will override all options except skip_port.  The syntax is the same as
# skip port.
#
# use_port switch1 = Gi1/1 Fa2/2


# IPv6 Max Age: Only include IPv6 entries less than this age (1-120+)
#
# Note: By default all entries included, a setting of 1 only included active
# entries with an age of 0.  Comment out or set to 0 to include all entries in
# the neighbor table.
#
#ipv6_maxage = 1

# Kill Timeout
#
# Kill -9 any scrapers still running after this time to prevent hung processes
# from locking up NetDB.  Default is 3600

## To enable NAC, uncomment nac_file below and set useNAC = 1 in netdb-cgi.conf
