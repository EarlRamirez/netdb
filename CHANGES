What's new in v1.13

- Last IP for switchport data is now stored in the switchport table rather than
  with the mac address, so the IP should reflect the last IP that was on the
  switchport rather than the last IP the mac address had.

- Added Comware/H3c, Force10 and Fortigate Support


What's new in v1.12.4:

- IOS WLC scraper support to pull wifi data from unified access layer
  deployements. This is enabled using the wifi flag in the -d device string
  option.


What's new in v1.12.3:

- Added description searches to CLI and CGI. Add desc_search to levelx_reports
  to enable functionality in CGI.

- Added Shut/No Shut, functionality to CGI and vlanchange.pl. Make sure user has
  vlan_change rights and shut/no shut functionality should show up. This is
  cisco only for now but there are plans to expand to other platforms in
  v1.13. See netdb.conf sample file for shut_script reference.

What's new in v1.12:

- Vastly improved Aruba wireless client tracking including client speed and AP
  details.

- Added update_interval to netdb.conf to keep track of how long mac addresses
  are connected to ports.  Make sure this is equal to how often you update your
  switch data in minutes (defaults to 15min).

- Added authgroups to handle multiple groups of credentials for different groups
  of devices. See new netdb.conf.

- Added lastup field to switchstatus to track the last time a port was connected
  rather than relying on cross correlating mac address data.  See upgrade about
  running update_lastup.pl to fixup your database timestamps.

- VRF and router display support. Updated CSV output for VRF and router, may
  break your custom scripts built against CSV output

- Added support for tracking individual mac/vlan associations on trunk ports for
  vmware or edge trunk ports.  Vlan will show up as xxx(t) to denote that the
  port is a trunk port and the specific mac is on a certain vlan on the port
  instead of simply showing trunk.

- Keeps track of mac/vlan association in historical switchport data rather than
  showing the current vlan configured on a port (if supported by scraper).
  Shows discrepency with (*) between a configured vlan on a port and the last
  vlan a mac was seen on on that port.

- Voice vlans now show up next to phones with a (*) to show that the device is
  not on the default vlan on the port (if supported by scraper).

- Added use_port option to force importing of port data no matter what on a
  port.

- Added p_minutes and p_uptime for to track how long a port has been connected.

- Added hung process control, install libproc-processtable-perl or
  Proc::ProcessTable


What's new in v1.11.x:

- Added arubaswitchscraper.pl support from Dustin Heywood

- Added gethost option to grab hostnames directly from devices and use IP
  addresses in devicelist.csv file. This is not preferred and will adversely
  impact performance, but it's an option now.

- The old ciscoscraper.pl has been deprecated and there are now standalone
  scrapers for IOS, NX-OS and ASAs.  See the UPGRADE documents.

- CDP/LLDP/FDP data is now collected from devices and available as CSV output or
  in the CGI page.  This is still experimental, please report any bugs or
  issues.

- Included sendjob script to send changes to devices, backup configs and save
  configurations to NVRAM.  Experimental support.

- v1.11.1 contains the new subversion repository URL:
  svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/netdbtracking/code/branches/netdb-1.11  

- See the UPGRADE


What's new in v1.10.4:

- Created standalone IOS and ASA scrapers.  ciscoscraper.pl still works for IOS,
  ASA and NXOS, but will be discontinued in v1.11 in favor of standalone
  scripts.

- Fixed SSH enable bug in NetDBHelper.pm


What's new in v1.10.3:

- Included SVN repository, from now on you can do svn update to update to the
  latest version

What's new in v1.10.2:

- See the UPGRADE document before installing

- Added dedicated NX-OS scraper, devtype nxos. Improved NX-OS support
  for descriptions.  Old scraper still supports NX-OS but support will
  be dropped in v1.11 in favor of the nxosscraper.

- Ability to configure use_trunks from the devicelist.csv file

- Improved secondary credential support and login error messages

- Added use_fqdn knob in netdb.conf to use the FQDN for switch names
  instead of just hostnames (changing this on an existing database will
  destroy historical data on switches because the names will all change)


What's new in v1.10:

- See the UPGRADE document before installing

- v1.10.1: Improved debugging and error handling in new scrapers

- Experimental VM "appliance" in vmware folder on Sourceforge

- Refactored netdbscraper to support modular plug-in scripts for multiple
  devices

- Added a devtype option to netdb.conf to change the default device type (hard
  coded to cisco for old config files)

- Changed the default Cisco mac address command to "show mac
  address-table". Still catches errors and uses alternate "show
  mac-address-table" on select devices that can't handle the other format

- Improved telnet support for large address tables (SSH is still recommended)

- Switched to keywords arp,nomac,ipv6 from netdbarp,netdbnomac,netdbv6 in the
  devicelist.csv file, but old device files are not affected.

- Added wildcards to vlan_change authorization for multiple switch definitions.

- Improved SSH secondary credentials fallback support

  - No support for IPv6 VRFs yet
  - IPv6 addresses are stored as fixed length 32 character strings
