# Access Control #
####################################################################################
# By default, users are authorized to access all reports (Level 2 and below)
#
# To restrict users, make the default auth level 0 or 1.  Then put restricted report 
# types under level1_reports or level2_reports.  Add the usernames that are
# allowed to access those reports in the level1_access or level2_access options 
# below and seperate the usernames by spaces.
#
# You can also restrict the maximum number of results allowed, based on the user
# level, by changing the level#_maxcount options below.

## Default Auth Level for users accessing the database
default_auth_level = 2

# Note: Usernames are seperated by spaces, terminate a line with \ to start a new 
# line

# Vlan Change Access
#
# You can grant the ability to change vlans to users on a network wide basis by
# using vlan_change via the access levels above.  Alternatively you can grant
# vlan change access to users on a per switch basis.  Once enabled, a pencil
# icon will appear next to the vlan in the switch report which will call the
# vlan change script.
#
# Wildcards: supports *sw1 building* and building*sw1
