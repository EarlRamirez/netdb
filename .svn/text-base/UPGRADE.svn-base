NetDB Upgrade Instructions
==========================

General Upgrade Instructions:

- Always backup your database with netdbctl -bu backup.sql command before
  attempting an upgrade.  The location you save to must be writable by the netdb
  user even if you run this as root.

- The two upgrade types are minor point releases (1.8.1 to 1.8.2) or major
  releases (1.8.3 to 1.9.0)

- For upgrading between more than one major version, just follow the major
  upgrade instructions first and then follow the specific version upgrade
  instructions below for each major version starting from your current release to the
  latest.  

- You can find your major version number my running netdb from the CLI
  with no options.


======================================================================
General Information on Minor Release Upgrades (eg. v1.10.1 to v1.10.4)
======================================================================

- If you have a newer installed version, try just doing an SVN update

  su netdb
  cd /opt/netdb
  svn update

- Otherwise you can untar the new netdb.tar.gz over the old directory.  MAKE
  SURE you su to the netdb user first to preserve the netdb user permissions.

  netdbctl -bu /home/netdb/netdb-backup.sql
  su netdb
  cd /opt/netdb
  tar zxvf netdb-x.y.z.tar.gz


==================================================================
SVN and VMWare Major Upgrade Instructions (eg. v1.12.x to v1.13.x)
==================================================================

- If your build has the /opt/netdb/.svn/ repository, you can upgrade to a new
  version more easily than the older upgrade process.

- Make a copy of the old install

  # Remove old directory if it exists
  sudo rm -r /opt/netdb.old

  # Make a copy of the current install
  sudo cp /opt/netdb /opt/netdb.old

- Change to the netdb user and change to the netdb directory

  sudo su - netdb
  cd /home/netdb

- Change to the latest release repository (v1.12 currently)

  - Run svn info to make sure you have an svn enabled install, otherwise use
    deprecated upgrade instructions below

    svn info

Path: .

  - *** Version 1.10 Users ONLY ***: If you are upgrading to version v1.11 or greater
    from v1.10, the repository sourceforge URL has to be changed:

  svn switch --relocate https://netdbtracking.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/netdbtracking/branches/netdb-1.10 svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/netdbtracking/code/branche\
s/netdb-1.11

  If you are upgrading from v1.11 to a newer version, you can just
  change to the latest branch version such as v1.13.

  svn switch "svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/netdbtracking/code/branches/netdb-1.13" .

- Run an SVN update to get the latest version

  svn update

- Backup and then upgrade the database to the latest version

  netdbctl -bu /opt/netdb/netdbbackup.sql

  mysql -u root -p netdb

  Note: if you are using the VM image, the default password is netdbadmin3742

  Important: If you are upgrading multiple major versions, you need to run each
  upgrade script in succession to upgrade your database, so v1.10-to-v1.11 then
  v1.11-to-v1.12.

  use netdb;
  source /opt/netdb/sql/upgrade-v1.12-to-v1.13.sql

  exit

- If you are using the VM image, move to the specific version notes below, done
  with this section.

- If you are using SVN but not using the VM image, follow these instructions to
  update the CGI code.

- Copy over the updated /opt/netdb/extra/depends/* contents to /var/www/depends/

  cp -r /opt/netdb/extra/depends/* /var/www/depends/

- Copy and rename /opt/netdb/netdb.cgi.pl to /usr/lib/cgi-bin/netdb.pl (note,
  it's netdb.cgi.pl --> netdb.pl )

  cp /opt/netdb/netdb.cgi.pl /usr/lib/cgi-bin/netdb.pl

*** DEPRECATED ****
Old Major Release Upgrades Instructions (eg. v1.10.x to v1.11.x)

DEPRECATED: Use SVN Instructions below if on v1.10.x or later
================================================================

NOTE: If you have installed v1.10.3 or later, you can do an SVN upgrade instead below

General Instructions for Major upgrade, see specific notes below.  Perform these
changes as the root user:

  sudo su -

- Perform a backup of the database first and save this file somewhere netdb has
  write permissions.

  netdbctl -bu /home/netdb/netdb-backup.sql

- Stop the jobs in cron or just stop cron during the upgrade.

  /etc/init.d/cron stop

- Important: Move the /opt/netdb directory to a backup location such as /opt/netdb.old/ 
  (you will need this).

  mv /opt/netdb/ /opt/netdb.old/

- Untar the new netdb.tar.gz file in to the /opt directory (as root)

  tar zxvf /tmp/netdb-1.9.0.tar.gz /opt/

- Remove the /opt/netdb/data directory and replace it with the contents of your data directory from
  your backup location above.

  rm -r /opt/netdb/data/
  cp -r /opt/netdb.old/data/ /opt/netdb/

- Restore netdb user permissions
    
  chown -R netdb /opt/netdb/
  chgrp -R netdb /opt/netdb/

- Apply the MySQL databasechanges using the upgrade script for your version from
  /opt/netdb/sql/, instructions are included in the upgrade script file.

  more /opt/netdb/sql/upgrade-v1.X-to-v1.Y.sql

- Copy over the updated /opt/netdb/extra/depends/* contents to /var/www/depends/

  cp -r /opt/netdb/extra/depends/* /var/www/depends/

- Copy and rename /opt/netdb/netdb.cgi.pl to /usr/lib/cgi-bin/netdb.pl (note,
  it's netdb.cgi.pl --> netdb.pl )

  cp /opt/netdb/netdb.cgi.pl /usr/lib/cgi-bin/netdb.pl

- See the specific upgrade notes for your version below

- Afterwards, run a manual 'netdbctl -ud -a -m -v' update and check the
  control.log and netdb.error file for any errors.

  netdbctl -ud -a -m -v

- Restart cron
  
  /etc/init.d/cron start

- See the CHANGES file and look through the netdb.conf and netdb-cgi.conf file for any
  new features that interest you.

- See any specific notes below for upgrading from an earlier major version to
  the latest


=============================================
Notes for upgrading to NetDB v1.13 from v1.12
=============================================

- Follow the major upgrade instructions from above (backup your database!)

- Run the SQL update script if you haven't already:
  See /opt/netdb/sql/upgrade-v1.12-to-v1.13.sql


=============================================
Notes for upgrading to NetDB v1.12 from v1.11
=============================================

- Follow the major upgrade instructions from above (backup your database!)

- Run the SQL update script if you haven't already:
  See /opt/netdb/sql/upgrade-v1.11-to-v1.12.sql

- Install libproc-processtable-perl for Debian/Ubuntu or Proc::ProcessTable from
  CPAN

- Set the update_interval option in /etc/netdb.conf to be equal to the number of
  minutes between updates in your /etc/crontab.  By default this is 15 minutes
  but if you run netdb updates once an hour, set this to 60, or if you run every
  5 minutes set it to 5.

- Run the /opt/netdb/extra/update_lastup.pl script to populate the lastup field
  for switchports from your old mac address data.  This is a more reliable
  method of tracking when the last time a port was used and will be the primary
  source of unused switchport data in future releases.  First run the script
  with -v to see what changes it will apply, and then run the script with
  -update to make the changes.

  /opt/netdb/extra/update_lastup.pl -v
  /opt/netdb/extra/update_lastup.pl -update


- New features in 1.12.3:

- Added description searches to CLI and CGI. Add desc_search to levelx_reports
  to enable functionality in CGI.

- Added Shut/No Shut, functionality to CGI and vlanchange.pl. Make sure user has
  vlan_change rights and shut/no shut functionality should show up. This is
  cisco only for now but there are plans to expand to other platforms in
  v1.13. See netdb.conf sample file for shut_script reference.

- Run a test update of the upgrade

  netdbctl -ud -a -m -v

- All done.

=============================================
Notes for upgrading to NetDB v1.11 from v1.10
=============================================

- Follow the major upgrade instructions from above

- Change the devtype variable to ios from cisco in netdb.conf if configured.
  ciscoscraper.pl has been deprecated, there are now standalone nxos, asa and
  ios scrapers.

- If you have ASAs or NX-OS devices using the old ciscoscraper.pl, set
  devtype=nxos or asa in the devicelist.csv file.

- Run the SQL update script:  
  See /opt/netdb/sql/upgrade-v1.10-to-v1.11.sql

- Run a test update of the upgrade

  netdbctl -ud -a -m -v

- If you want to enable the new neighbor discovery on an upgraded version, do
  these things:

  - Add nd_file = nd.csv to netdb.conf
  - Add use_nd = 1 to netdb.conf
  - Add -nd option to your netdbctl job in /etc/crontab
  - Data should start populating nd.csv
  - If you do a CSV report on a switch or use the CGI, neighbor data should start showing up

- All done.

============================================
Notes for upgrading to NetDB v1.10 from v1.9
============================================

- Follow the major upgrade instructions from above

- Run the SQL update script:
  See /opt/netdb/sql/upgrade-v1.9-to-v1.10.sql

- If you need support for a new device type, make sure to add devtype=xxx in
  your config file.  Supported scrapers are in /opt/netdb/netdbscraper/

- If you plan to support wifi location data with the new Aruba and Cisco WLC
  scrapers, add "wifidata" to an appropriate reporting level in
  /etc/netdb-cgi.conf.  Wireless data is not displayed by default due to privacy
  concerns and old config files don't have this option.

- There is a new delete option in netdbctl to delete only wifi switchport data.
  Wifi data is stored by switch (controller) and port (AP) in the database, but
  is flagged as wifi data to be handled specially from wired switchports.

- If you are using Bradford integration, there is a new script bclientdump.pl
  which will process data from the client utility on the Bradford server. Put
  the dumped data in to a file in /opt/netdb/data/ and define it as
  bradford_client_file = file.txt in netdb.conf.  Then change your Bradford
  update method from netdbctl -un -n to netdbctl -un2 -n.  The old method is
  still supported but deprecated, as the new method gathers much more accurate
  data.


===========================================
Notes for upgrading to NetDB v1.9 from v1.8
===========================================

- Follow the Major Release upgrade instructions above

- Requires libio-socket-inet6-perl, use Debian/Ubuntu package:
    apt-get install libio-socket-inet6-perl

- Run the SQL update script
  See /opt/netdb/sql/upgrade-v1.8-to-v1.9.sql


===========================================
Notes for upgrading to NetDB v1.8 from v1.7
===========================================

- Follow the Major Release upgrade instructions above

- If you plan to allow the changing of vlans with the included script, define
  the vlan_log in your netdb.conf file and follow the instructions in the
  INSTALL document.  Make sure the netdb user has rights.

- Long descriptions and other new features should be enabled by default

- If you have any other scripts based off of the CSV output, the switch report
  CSV output has changed, which will affect any scripts based on it.

===========================================
