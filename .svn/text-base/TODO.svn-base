- Daemon Scraper Plan
 - Master daemon process would spawn individual scrapers and monitor them
 - Use sockets for interprocess communication
 - Scrapers maintain stand-alone functionality in addition to daemon functionality
 - When running in daemon mode, scrapers write to daemon directory with individual files for each scraper
 - Master daemon would kick off update event to scraper
 - At end of update, master daemon would receive completion message, then import the files
 - Event timers to check on scrapers, if not heard back from then kill individual scrapers and report
 - concurrency?
 - Would update db process queue updates one at a time or run in parallel?
 - Daemonize updatenetdb.pl?
 - Detect and deal with disconnects, restart scrapers daily to remain sane?
